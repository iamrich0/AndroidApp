# AndroidApp
This was a university project I bulit with my group allocated by our lecture.

We built an anonymous counselling system that runs on android. Basically what the app does is that users can 
recieve help with mental health issues which include depression and more from qualified psychologists anonymously.

We used Android studio to write the source Code in Java. OkHttp for network requests, OkHttp is a tool 
that helps developers send and receive data over the internet in their Java or Kotlin programs.
We used PHP for the backend of the app. We used SQL to store user and counselor data.

Since the Source codes are bigger than 50mb, I cannot post them on the github, you can find them here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nCeLrXHYDqVu5w8RVn3i6xqkbdF69K0d/view?usp=sharing.

Below is the video of how the app works https://drive.google.com/file/d/1az8EnKNF3Py8WLoHZVmlDnn7XMdg9DIG/view?usp=sharing.
